This book addresses mathematical theories, but also suggests possible theoretical innovations for many issues, providing a stimulating reference for both students and researchers.},

The first experiment shows a strong anticorrelation between the triggered detections on both sides of a beam splitter. This result is in contradiction with any classical wave model of light, but in agreement with a quantum description involving single-photon states. The same source and detection scheme were used in a second experiment, where we have observed interferences with a visibility over 98%.}

A wealth of accompanying figures and exercises illustrate and  develop the material in more depth. They describe what a quantum computer  is, how it can be used to solve problems faster than familiar "classical"  computers, and the real-world implementation of quantum computers. Their  book concludes with an explanation of how quantum states can be used to  perform remarkable feats of communication, and of how it is possible to  protect quantum states against the effects of noise.  }},
